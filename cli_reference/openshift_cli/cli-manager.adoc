// TODO intro

Cluster administrators can use the OpenShift CLI Manager to make certain OpenShift CLI (`oc`) plug-ins available for their cluster users. Cluster users can then choose which of the available CLI plug-ins to install locally.

// TODO: Do we want to reference the disconnected env use case? How it makes it easier to manage plug-ins

// TODO: Is there enough info we'll add to warrant a concept module, or should this just stay in the assembly?
