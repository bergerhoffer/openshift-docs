= Installing the {cert-manager-operator} using the web console

You can use the web console to install the {cert-manager-operator}.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have access to the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

. Enter *{cert-manager-operator}* into the filter box.

. Select the *{cert-manager-operator}* and click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page:
.. The *Update channel* is set to *stable-v1*, which installs the latest stable release of the {cert-manager-operator}.
+
// TODO: Right now I see "alpha", "stable-v1", "stable-v1.10", and tech-preview. Need to see if all of these will be available at GA or not, and if any shown should be avoided / descriptions provided
.. The *Installation Mode* is set to *A specific namespace on the cluster*. This mode installs the Operator in the Operator-recommended `cert-manager-operator` namespace to watch and be made available to all namespaces in the cluster.
+
// TODO: See if above description needs adjusted. Maybe delete the part about installing in the ns, because that is covered later
.. Choose the *Installed Namespace* for the Operator. The default Operator recommended namespace is `cert-manager-operator`.
+
// TODO: Confirm that the namespace was purposefully changed. Also check on the OLM files that are using "openshift-cert-manager-operator" to see if that is affected (Alex Greene)
+
If the `cert-manager-operator` namespace does not exist, it is created for you.
+
// TODO: I also see a "cert-manager" namespace. Look into that - was that created too?
+
// .. Click the *Enable Operator recommended cluster monitoring on the Namespace* checkbox to enable cluster monitoring for the Operator.
+
// TODO: Ask why this checkbox is gone
.. Select an *Update approval* strategy.
+
* The *Automatic* strategy allows Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to automatically update the Operator when a new version is available.
+
* The *Manual* strategy requires a user with appropriate credentials to approve the Operator update.

.. Click *Install*.

.Verification

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
. Verify that *{cert-manager-operator}* is listed with a *Status* of *Succeeded* in the `cert-manager-operator` namespace.
